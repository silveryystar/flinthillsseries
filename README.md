# Flint Hills Series Graphing
This tool graphs the Flint Hills series and its derivatives to experimentally determine its value of convergence (or inevitable divergence).

# Setup
1. Install Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download repository.
3. Open Terminal in repository folder.
4. Enter ```pip install matplotlib```.
5. Enter ```python main.py```.

# Usage
Run *main.py* via ```python main.py``` in Terminal.
```Maximum n:``` will print.
Enter the maximum integer value to which to calculate the Flint Hills series.

After, the code will plot the series and its derivatives.

# Example
Suppose the user wants to graph the Flint Hills series and its first and second derivatives to **1000000** (10^6).
Run *main.py* via ```python main.py``` in Terminal.
When ```Maximum n:``` prints, enter ```1000000```.

When the code finishes, a plot of the series and its derivatives will open.
Click the "save the figure" icon, the rightmost option located at the bottom left of the figure, to download the figure.
For this example, the figure is saved as *Figure_0* in the repository.

# Errors
1. ```Invalid input. Enter integer value.```
Solution: Enter an integer (0, 1, 2, etc.).
